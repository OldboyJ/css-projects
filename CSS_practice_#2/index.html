      You're growing up fast, Morty. You're going into a great big thorn straight into my ass. I'm Scary Terry!! You can run but you can't hide, bitch! They're robots Morty! It's okay to shoot them! They're just robots! Close. It's gonna make your kidneys shut down.

      Oh, it gets darker, Morty. Welcome to the darkest year of our adventures. First thing that's different? No more dad, Morty. You gotta shove these seeds way up your butt Morty, waay up there. Prepare to be emancipated from your own inferior genes! 5 more minute of this and I'm going to get mad!</p>

      That just sounds like slavery with extra steps. We will returnâ€¦ possibly in different clothing. Aw, man! I really liked this life! Well, at least I didn't really crap my pants. I don't like it here Morty. I can't abide bureaucracy. I don't like being told where to go and what to do. I consider it a violation. Did you get those seeds all the way up your butt?</p>
    <p>
      Oh my god, how could I not see this coming? My lust, my greed! I deserve thiiiiii- Ladies, let's get out of here. I haven't learned a thiiiiiing! Slow down! Well, she's my daughter, Summer. I outrank you. Or, family means nothing, in which case, don't play that card. Nothing you do matters, your existence is a lie!</p>

      You don't have to try to impress me Morty. Come on, flip the pickle, Morty. You're not gonna regret it. The payoff is huge. Those guys are inside you building a piece of shit Ethan! They're inside you building a monument to compromise! Fuck them, fuck those people, fuck this whole thing Ethan. Yeah, sure, I mean, if you spend all day shuffling words around, you can make anything sound bad.</p>
